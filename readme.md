About the project
-----------------

sMARS rover is a decent body for the SMARS modular robot. SMARS robot is really great project with a lot of add-ons and a big community behind it.

SMARS is a perfect project for start learning robotics and practice in 3D printing as well. And if after all, you would like your robot looks awesome, sMARS rover is a good option to try. Also, sMARS rover is good if you building a robot for kids.

sMARS rover was inspired by Jaxa Lunar rover by Toyota, Mars rover from the Martian movie, and the SMARS robot project of course.

Project features
----------------

* Good looking body which represents robot as Mars rover
* Full compatibility with SMARS robot and most add-ons
* Modular design, various addons still can be mounted
* Mount with standard screws for computer cases
* Includes source files for further improvements
* Includes examples of electronic assembles - connection shield, LED light
* Includes code examples including Bluetooth control
* Includes documentation for assembling and electronic parts

Additional SMARS add-ons
------------------------

* Chassis for holding 2x14500 batteries. Also has a space for a mini motor driver board.
* Improved wheel with screw lock
* Reflected truck for reducing movement distortion

All add-ons are optional for sMARS rover, every add-on including the body itself can be used independently.

Models for 3D printing on Thingiverse: [thingiverse.com/thing:5028894](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5028894). The same files are also placed in [3d-print](/3d-print) folder of this repo.
